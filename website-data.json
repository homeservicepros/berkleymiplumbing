        "content": "<p>As trusted plumbing professionals serving the Berkley community, we've seen our fair share of plumbing mishaps, especially in neighborhoods like <a href='/service-area/angell-park-48072'>Angell Park</a> and <a href='/service-area/berkley-west-48072'>Berkley West</a>. Today, we're sharing the most common plumbing mistakes that can lead to expensive repairs and how to avoid them.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Using Chemical Drain Cleaners as a First Resort</h2>\n<p>Many homeowners, particularly in the <a href='/service-area/city-center-48072'>City Center</a> area, immediately reach for chemical drain cleaners when facing a clog. However, these harsh chemicals can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Damage your pipes over time</li>\n<li>Create toxic fumes</li>\n<li>Worsen existing pipe problems</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Instead, consider our professional <a href='/services/hydro-jetting-drain-cleaning-services-berkley-mi'>Hydro Jetting Drain Cleaning Services</a> for a safe, effective solution.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Ignoring Small Leaks</h2>\n<p>That minor drip under your kitchen sink might seem harmless, but it can lead to significant water damage and mold growth. As we often remind our customers in <a href='/service-area/berkley-south-48072'>Berkley South</a>, small leaks can waste hundreds of gallons of water annually and increase your utility bills.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Improper Garbage Disposal Use</h2>\n<p>Many of our emergency calls involve garbage disposal issues. Common mistakes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disposing of fibrous foods</li>\n<li>Putting grease down the disposal</li>\n<li>Running the disposal without water</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For proper maintenance or installation, check out our <a href='/services/garbage-disposal-installation-berkley-mi'>Garbage Disposal Installation</a> services.</p>\n\n<h2>4. DIY Water Heater Repairs</h2>\n<p>Water heater problems require professional attention. As discussed in our <a href='/blog/berkley-homeowners-guide-to-water-heater-maintenance'>Berkley Homeowners Guide to Water Heater Maintenance</a>, attempting DIY repairs can be dangerous and potentially void your warranty. Trust our <a href='/services/water-heater-repair-berkley-michigan'>Water Heater Repair</a> experts instead.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Neglecting Outdoor Plumbing Maintenance</h2>\n<p>Berkley's seasonal changes can be harsh on outdoor plumbing. We frequently assist homeowners in <a href='/service-area/berkley-southwest-48072'>Berkley Southwest</a> with issues that could have been prevented through regular maintenance.
